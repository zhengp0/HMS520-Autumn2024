# Code Refactor

In this exercise, we will work with script `dm_sequelae_split.R` from real application. We will dissect the "dos" and "don'ts", and improve the code in

-   Readability
-   Extentability

There are the most important aspects when designing a script. Readability will help us maintain and repurpose the code. And extentability will allow us to adpat the new tasks fast and reliably.

## Steps

-   Understand the function of the code
-   Identify the issues of the code
    -   what makes it hard to read?
    -   what makes it error-prune?
    -   what makes it hard to test?
    -   what makes it hard to extend?
-   Focus on each issue think about the solution

## Common issues

In this exercise, we will target at common issues, including

-   Script multiple responsibilities
-   Inconsistent naming of variables and functions
-   Inconsistent coding style
-   Hard-coded global values
-   Code repetition

## Acknowledgement

The script `dm_sequelae_split.R` is provided by Liane Ong's team from IHME. Thanks very much for the generosity of helping us improve our coding skills!
